# PointChess

In the typical game of chess, pieces are constrained in their movement by other pieces. For example, if a Queen is attempting to move 6 pieces forward, and there is a pawn in front of the Queen,
the Queen will only be able to capture the pawn or not move forward at all. 

PointChess differentiates itself by now allowing pieces to move through opponent pieces, if they are powerful enough. For example, a Queen is capable of traveling through 9 points worth of
material to get to a target square. This is because a Queen is worth 9 points. 

For game-balancing purposes, pieces are not allowed to traverse through their side's pawns. Since moving through pieces is now allowed, the concept of checks are no longer existent.
This requires players to be more wary of what moves they are making as the king can be captured through other pieces.
